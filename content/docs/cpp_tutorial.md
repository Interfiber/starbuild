title: Starbuild with C++
---
By default starbuild comes with a C++ plugin! To get started create a new project by running ```starbuild init```. Then uncomment the lines in starbuild.lua for the C++ plugin. Your starbuild file should now look like
```lua
-- Starbuild config file, generated by 'starbuild init'
-- all config must be in the Config function
local star = {}
-- when starbuild runs this function, it will pass in a table with starbuild functions in it.
function star.Config(starbuild)
       -- configure default plugins.
       -- set plugins. Uncomment the one for your language.
       -- C/C++
       starbuild.LoadPlugin('DEFAULT_CPP')
       starbuild.RunPluginTrigger('CPPBuild', { 'foo.hpp', 'foo.cpp' })
end
-- return config
return star
```
Now you need to learn a little bit of [lua](https://lua.org). Remove all of the files names from the trigger function or just replace the trigger function with whats below
```lua
starbuild.RunPluginTrigger('CPPBuild', {  })
```
Now to test starbuild I just added a hello_world.cpp file to the list, now it looks like this
```lua
starbuild.RunPluginTrigger('CPPBuild', { 'hello_world.cpp' })
```
Great! Now we are ready to run our build! To run our build simply run ```starbuild run``` in your terminal, after the build completes we can now see an ```a.out``` file in the current folder. To run our program just do
```bash
./a.out
```
Thats a quick intro to starbuilds C++ plugin!
