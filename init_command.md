# Creating a new starbuild.lua file
a ```starbuild.lua``` file is a small file that you can build your project with. If you use gradle think of it like a ```build.gradle```. To generate a starbuild.lua config file you can run the following command
```bash
starbuild init
```
This command will create a new starbuild.lua file in the current working directory.
